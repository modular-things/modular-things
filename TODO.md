Pairing virtual objects with hardware devices leads to versioning issues. This makes a strong case for self-describing devices.

I think a good notion to keep in mind is software that composes hardware is fine but (1 software object takes many hardware objects) but having to have twins is problematic (1 software to 1 hardware).
