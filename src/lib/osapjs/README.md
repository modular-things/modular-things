## OSAP for JS (and TS)

The [Open Systems Assembly Protocol (OSAP!)](http://osap.tools/) is a new approach for the generation and integration of modular, interoperable hardware systems, and a love letter to computer plumbing and hardware heterogeneity.

This is the typescript library, that speaks to embedded and python partners. See [osap.tools](http://osap.tools) for more detail.

The [modular-things](https://github.com/modular-things/modular-things) project is the most stable instantiation of an OSAP-based project.
